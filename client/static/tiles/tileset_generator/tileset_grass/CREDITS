Thanks a lot at Clint Bellanger for creating the amazing grass-tileset
http://opengameart.org/content/grassland-tileset .

This tileset here is only a slightly changed version from the original
grassland_shapes.blend, I added height-transitions and alpha-transitions.
Also the texture-uv-mapping is changed.
